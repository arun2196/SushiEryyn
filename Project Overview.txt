Backend Components
1. User Registration and Authentication
User Model: Define a User entity with fields for username, phone number, address, and password.
Password Security: Use hashing algorithms (e.g., BCrypt) to securely store passwords.
Registration & Login: Create endpoints for user registration and login, ensuring secure transmission and storage of user credentials.
2. Sushi Inventory Management
Sushi Model: Define a Sushi entity with fields for name, type, price, and description.
CRUD Operations: Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for managing the sushi items in the database.
3. Order Management
Order Model: Define an Order entity with fields for Order ID, Customer ID, Order Status, and a list of items.
Order Processing: Implement logic for creating, updating, and retrieving orders.
4. Security Considerations
Authentication: Implement JWT or session-based authentication for user sessions.
Authorization: Ensure only registered users can access the shop and make purchases.
Frontend Interfaces
1. Homepage
Design: Create a visually appealing homepage with the shop's branding, sushi images, and information.
User Actions: Include buttons for Sign in and Sign up, leading to respective forms.
2. Shop
Navigation Bar: Provide navigation options for accessing the Cart and Logout.
Product Display: Show sushi items with images, names, descriptions, and prices.
Cart Interaction: Allow users to add items to the cart.
3. Cart
Cart Display: List all items in the cart with quantities and prices.
Modify Cart: Provide options to remove items or change quantities.
Checkout: Include a button to confirm the purchase and place the order.
4. Staff View
Order Monitoring: Display a list of all orders with details like Order ID, Items, Total, Customer ID, and Order Status.
Filter Orders: Allow staff to filter and view only incomplete orders.
Additional Considerations
Scalability & Future Enhancements
Discount Functionality: Design the database and application logic to easily incorporate discounts in the future.
Admin Features: Consider adding administrative features for managing users, orders, and inventory.
Tech Stack & Tools
Backend: Java Spring Boot for RESTful APIs, Spring Security for authentication, JPA/Hibernate for ORM.
Database: H2 for development, with the potential to switch to MySQL for production.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly a frontend framework like React for dynamic content.
Testing: JUnit for unit tests, Postman for API testing.
Version Control: Git for version control, with a GitHub repository for collaboration and code management.
Next Steps
Database Schema Design: Start by designing the database schema for the User, Sushi, and Order entities.
Set Up Development Environment: Set up your Java Spring Boot project, database, and version control.
Develop Authentication & User Management: Implement user registration and login functionality.
Develop Sushi Management: Create the API endpoints and database interactions for managing sushi items.
Build Frontend Interfaces: Start with the homepage and gradually develop the Shop, Cart, and Staff View.
