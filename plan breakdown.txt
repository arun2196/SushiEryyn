### **Phase 4: Testing, Optimization, and Additional Features**

#### **8. Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - **Unit Testing:**
     - Write unit tests for controllers, services, and repositories.
   - **Integration Testing:**
     - Test the entire application flow, including user registration, sushi management, and order processing.

#### **9. Deployment & Production Setup**
   - **Database Switch:** 
     - Prepare for a switch to a production database like MySQL.
   - **Deployment:** 
     - Set up deployment pipelines and deploy to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
